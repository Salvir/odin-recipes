This project is a basic recipe website

This will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes, demonstrating my early html skills including:
 - Building a baseboard
 - usage of elements and tags including:
    - <strong> and <em>
    - <ol> and <ul>
    - linking pages with <a>
    - and adding images with <img>

To be updated as I progress through the Odin lessons on CSS and JS
